--- GUESSING GAME ---

PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Since the project is going to be quite small, i will develop all feature on single branch.
- Game logic will be built in single JS file, visuals are going to be divided by HTML and separate CSS file.
- Firstly i will develop desktop-only version, but i want to pracrice on making adaptive layout, so i will make the game for mobile in the future.

LAYOUT AND STYLES
- My font of choice: Orbitron
- I decided to make a neu-brutalistic design, with some bright colors and destinct borders.
- Color scheme: #f44444 #f55757 #fcccb4 #cfeb88 #50657b #ff945f #a8b6b2 #1dbbbe #53a3a9 font color: #212529

RESTARTING FUNCTIONS
- I have two ways of restarting the game- via 'Restart' button, that simply sets score to it's normal value and resets all CSS styles back to default. And i have 'Save and restart' button in the menu. It will restart the game with new min and max values between which the player will guess the number.
- NO I need to have a two sets of min/max variables - one that will be displayed and second that will be set in the menu which value will be assigned to the displayed value. NO
- Instead of separate variables I made an array that stores max and min values. First two values are default 1 and 20, when user sets new values they get added to the end of array.
- I want to make one function for both of my restart-buttons.

DISPLAY FEATURES
- I can disble event-handlers at will by using '.removeEventListener('click', functionName)' method. Used this to make the 'Submit' button inactive when player wins or loses the game.
- This symbol 'Ã—' looks pretty good as closing button.
